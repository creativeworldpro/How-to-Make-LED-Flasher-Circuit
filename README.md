A mini LED flash light circuit is a simple and compact electronic circuit that uses a few components to power a small LED for illumination purposes. The circuit consists of a power source, an LED, and a resistor to limit the current flow to the LED.


Component List - 

To make a mini LED flash light, the circuit can be enclosed in a small plastic or metal casing with a switch to turn it on and off. A small keychain or lanyard can also be attached to the casing to make it easy to carry around.


Additional components, such as capacitors or transistors, can be added to the circuit to control the brightness or flashing pattern of the LED.
All component list have to been given below.

Component List -

1.	PCB - made by JLCPCB

2.	LED - 5mm (10 Pieces)

3.	Transistor - Tip 41c, BD 139

4.	Resistor - 56 KΩ

5.	Capacitor - 100µf/35v

6.	Power Source - DC 12v


Transistor Pin Out - 

Tip 41

The pin arrangement may vary depending on the manufacturer or package type, but the pin functions remain the same.

1. Base

2. Collector

3. Emitter


BD 139

The pin arrangement may vary depending on the manufacturer or package type, but the pin functions remain the same.

1. Emitter

2. Base

3. Collector


Feature of LED Flasher Light -

1.	Low component count

2.	Low power consumption

3.	Adjustable flashing rate

4.	Wide operating voltage range

5.	Compact size

6.	Easy to integrate

7.	Reliable

8.	Easy to modify

9.	Low heat generation

10.	Multiple LED support


Make 12v LED Light -

Since it is a 12v LED light project circuit, for that we need to use DC-12v led light. Though we are using 3v led light, for that we need to convert 3v led light to 12v led light.

We use 4 pieces 3v LED light to make a 12v LED light. We connect one LED positive leg with another LED negative leg. In this way we will leg a 12v LED light.

This way, we might make 2 pieces 12v LED light. Then we connect 2 pieces 12v LED light positive leg with each other.


Connect Transistor with Circuit -

To make this circuit, 1st we connect one transistor with another transistor. We connect TIP41c transistor emitter leg with BD139 transistor emitter leg.


Connect Resistor with Circuit -

Now we need to connect resistor with the circuit. We connect resistor one side with each other. We got three terminal of this LED light.

This time we connect resistor common side with LED positive leg and the rest two terminals with both transistor Base leg.


Connect Capacitor with Circuit -

To make this circuit, we are using two pieces 100uf/ 16v capacitor. Now we connect capacitor with the circuit. Now we connect this two capacitor positive leg with both transistor Collector leg.

The capacitor positive leg connected with BD139 transistor, connect that capacitor negative leg with TIP41c transistor Base leg.
In the same way, the capacitor positive leg connected with TIP41c transistor, connect that capacitor negative leg with BD139 transistor Base leg.


Soldering and Cleaning -

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Connect Power & Enjoy the Circuit -

For power supply, we are using DC 12v. You can use 12v battery or can use the power supply that can provide DC 12v, then led light will blown away and the circuit may damage also.

Connect DC-12v positive cable with LED positive leg and connect DC-12v negative cable with emitter leg of transistor.
